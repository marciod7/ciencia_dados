"R3DWODGRFWEIDK","Humongous","I have several python books and the online stuff.  This one has the advantage of being current, exceediingly well written and a bit more perceptive of the hurdles facing someone poking along alone.  It's early days, but I look forward to crunching through this book.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024","Great so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",
"R1ZLSUNN45KPKF","Juan Zavala","Best Python book for Intermediate level users. First of all the foreword is written by Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, so that alone should be enough reason to buy it. This book gives you a deeper level of understanding on the basics of Python and crosses to more advanced topics such as OOP and Algorithm Design without overwhelming you. Make sure to type out all the code to re-enhance muscle memory. Half-way through reading this book you're going to feel like your doing magic, but you're just starting to understand the syntax and logic enough to start writing your own programs!","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2024","Best Python book for intermediate level","5.0 out of 5 stars","","9",
