"R3NY3KXV8N46K7","Owen C. Marshall","With the lockdown from the global pandemic, I have been forced to work from home like many other people. Since my usual job involved supporting hardware, this meant I was going to be stuck! Fortunately, my boss said that if I could spend my time learning skills useful to the lab, I could count the hours doing that. I asked whether learning Python would count. I told him that I would try to create scripts to monitor my hardware from home. He said that was acceptable.I have some programming experience, but it has been years since I coded, and then it was usually for relatively basic tasks in undergrad. I was looking for something that would not insult my intelligence, but that would still be interesting enough to keep me on task. So, after searching around I found this book. I saw the highly rated reviews. I skimmed the language that the author used in the sample. I read the table of contents and saw that the second part of the book consisted of creating games in order to solidify the skills learned.Yes! This sounded perfect.I have not been disappointed.The book walks the reader through setting up (checking if Python is on the computer already, downloading it if necessary, using an IDE and what that is, etc). And then it moves on to the usual basic programming. The writing is clear. I had no problems with the examples and found the practice problems to be well chosen. I also liked the way that the author encouraged good practices such as documentation and testing.I am currently in Part 2 of the book and have been working on the first project, a game called Alien Invasion which is basically a version of Space Invaders. I am definitely enjoying that. And I can see how some of the skills I learn from this could transfer over into monitoring my equipment. Reading files, taking user input, opening windows, drawing on the screen, making calculations, all of these things are necessary for the game, and for my own goals.I personally never had any problems, but I also noticed that the author's website includes cheat sheets, solutions, and errata, not to mention the files suggested for the projects.I am not sure if this book is for an absolute beginner. My experience is too far from that for me to be a good judge. But I can say that a person with basic programming knowledge and no prior knowledge of Python found it to be a great resource.","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020","Easy to Follow, Good Intro for Self Learner","5.0 out of 5 stars","","12",
"R270DXU8YVGFPX","Umar","In embarking on my journey to learn Python, I initially struggled with various online video courses and even subscribed to the paid version of Codecademy, only to find myself constantly backtracking. It wasn't until recently that I dusted off a book that had been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years.This book turned out to be a hidden gem. The clarity and structure of the content are truly commendable. The author's approach to presenting Python concepts made it easy for me to build upon what I learned, creating a strong foundation that kept me motivated throughout the process. I feel the way the book is organized seemed to unlock a seamless progression in my understanding of Python that once I would get to the exercises in the end I was actually able to work through those myself or at least knew what I needed to google to clarify what I needed further elaboration with.Whether you're delving into Python for professional reasons or simply as a personal endeavor, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.This book has made the learning journey enjoyable. If you're looking for a reliable companion on your Python learning path, this book is an excellent choice to get started.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2023","Great for starting your journey on learning python","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",

"R2IOYW8GNJDUAZ","G. W.","So far I've only made it to ""for loops"" chapter 4; but I think this is a really good book. I had an online class from a local University and this book has covered somethings that the class did not. Not that what the book covered and the class didn't has been major; but is interesting that only having reached chapter 4 in the book that there are things the class left out. So far the biggest change between this book and the class I took is that the book does a much better job of explaining for loops. I even watched a video on Youtube to teach you Python with no experience and even that did not do as good a job of explaining why a for loop is written the way it is. Being that the class I took was online and was one of those classes done in half the time (warp speed) I didn't bother to ask why a for loop is written the way it is I just wrote it and followed the class examples (and yes I passed the class with an A but Python is not my first programming language). I feel way more confident in learning Python after the book did such a good job of explaining for loops that as I continue with the book I believe it will explain things better then the class I took or the video I watched. On a side note the class I took, as all college classes I have taken do, required a book and that book just didn't do a good job of explaining for loops (go figure). You might be wondering why am I using this book if I took an online class and the answer is it has been awhile since I took that class so I need a refresher. Also the college that I took that class from doesn't offer another a following Python class to take unless you sign up for a degree program (and I already have a degree I just want to become proficient in Python). I would recommend that if you want to learn Python to use in a job to take at least one class from a college or another way to get proof that you learned Python other than studying it on your own. Also another reason to learn from a book with no class attached to it is you can learn at your own pace. Now I could learn from the book that I bought for the college course since the class only went so far into the book; but I just didn't find that book to be very well written and full of information one doesn't really need to learn how to program with Python. I feel like a ""college"" course book has a lot of bloat while a book like this one is more straight forward. A book like this one survives and sells or not because it is good etc while a college course book is chosen by the teacher or school regardless of the reviews it got. So after this extremely long review I would recommend this book; but I think one does need something (a class, certificate etc) to show proof that one has at least some Python knowledge outside of ones own studying.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2021","Recommend getting, but also get proof of Python knowledge elsewhere (see below)","5.0 out of 5 stars","","18",
"R2M2AT6AHNOA5V","geekandglitter","I am a beginner/intermediate Python programmer with many holes in my knowledge; thus I am using this book both for reference and for systematic self-teaching.I've never seen such a thorough, comprehensive, and easy to use table of contents and index in any technical book.  This makes the book as easy to use as a reference as it is a teaching tool through building projects.This author, who is a trained teacher, clearly has a rationale behind laying out every concept. It's no wonder it's been translated into several languages and is a best seller.The form factor, typeface, and spacing are also carefully planned, as each page draws the eye in.Another note of interest is that I, perhaps like many people, tend not to want to learn through building someone else's projects. I just want to learn what I need to build my own! Thus when I take online courses, I avoid those that are project based.  But a physical book can make it worthwhile to build the projects, because doing so makes it an even better reference afterward. That is, the projects become old friends rather than throw-away. I only thought of this now, looking at this book, because I am confident that if any teacher/author can make me build their project, this author can.As programmers, we all heavily use google to find answers. I am happy to now have a physical book at my side. And just to make this book even better, it comes with lots of free meta materials which the author is actively maintaining.  This book is a find.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020","Can be used both as a reference and a teaching tool","5.0 out of 5 stars","","4",
"R3G7MCXLOZGDTO","Some Guy","This is probably one of the best introductory programming books I've ever tried. Back when I was an undergraduate, I learned Pascal (yup, they still taught it at that point), C, and C++.  Neither the professors or the textbooks were very good at explaining...well...anything. Luckily, I was able to figure things out for myself, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth about programming (I've done scripting professionally, but it wasn't my primary role).Fast forward to now. I have one foot in each of 2 worlds - behavioral science and IT (networking and security). Both worlds use Python. I decided to get this book and finally sit down and learn it (I was briefly introduced to Python when I was an undergraduate and asked why we didn't have a class in it, I would have preferred it). This book has very clear, concrete examples and you learn by doing. For the first half (or a little more), you'll learn the basics of what you need to navigate the language. You'll do short exercises to lock in what you learn. Later on the book, you'll actually work on larger, more involved projects and the author guides you through with excellent explanations.Needless to say, I picked up Python faster than any language before it. I've come to really like the No Starch Press books as I find them (in general) to be well-written  and clear.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021","Great","5.0 out of 5 stars","","2",
"R6WTB2RTUXH5O","Amazon Customer","This book is excellent for anyone who wants to learn a computer language from the ground up.  It walks you through the free software to install (how to install it and trouble shoot any issues you may have), gives plenty of examples and discusses common errors, and has made learning Python easy and fun.My background is NOT in computer science, but in mathematics.  I have very little experience programming.  I purchased this book because my 10 year old was interested in learning to program and I wanted to be able to help him get started.  I'm not sure if he would have the patience to read the book on his own, but any adult or kid over the age of 13 should be good to go.The quality of construction of the book cover is ""meh"".  It came undone after a few days of use, but the binding is good (nothing a little glue in the spine wont fix).  The paper and printing are of good quality.  I wouldn't let this minor issue deter me from recommending this book to others.The software for python doesn't need much to run.  In fact, there are apps out there for running it on phones or tablets.  You don't need a full fledged PC to use this software (and again it is free).Best of luck programming.

"R37T2H59DR3WSL","Zerono","Wanted to add in a few tips, so beginners don't get discouraged. Just started reading this book yesterday, and immediately I ran into an issue with getting Sublime Text to work properly. If you're having the same problem, here's what's going wrong. On page 9, the author mentions that you can skip the part that says to create a ""New Build System"" if Python 3 is running correctly. If you were like me and you did not skip that part, then you might run into some issues. When you get to ""print(""Hello Python world!"")"" and go into Tools/Build System, choose ""Python,"" DO NOT choose ""Python3."" By creating a ""Python3.sublime-build"" you are creating an extra, and unnecessary, choice under ""Build System."" Also, the program will not run if you choose ""Python3"" that you've created. So skip the part that says to create ""Python3.sublime-build.""When the author says to create a folder called ""python_work,"" you can create that folder anywhere, but you should actually create it on your Desktop because he later references it on the Desktop. Any file saved as "".py"" is similar to files saved as .docx, .xlsl, or .txt, so don't worry about messing things up or crashing your program; it's just another file. You can move that folder and file around, and it will still work, just like any other Word file.Also, when you see "">>>"" it means that you need to run in terminal session. Go back and read page 4 or 6. Or click on the main Python 3.10 (64-bit) application, to go directly to Python terminal window.Lastly, remember that this book was written in 2018-2019, so the author is using Python 3.7.2. We are currently on 3.10.2. Certain things may look and function a bit differently, but the program language and concept will remain the same.print(""Good luck and happy coding!"")","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022","Tips for beginners","5.0 out of 5 stars","","10",
"R32IHODPYQN8CD","N8","I've had some programming experience in the past.  I've written very basic Perl and Python programs in the past, and have a solid understanding of the basics, such as strings, variables, functions, statements, etc.I got the book ""Learning Python"" and started going through it and was entirely lost; the book mostly focuses on using Python Interpreter for most of the examples, which made it confusing for me to follow along.This book, Python Crash Course is one of the best books I've ever worked with in learning to program anything.  The author explains everything in a very detailed, yet simplistic way, and even puts numbers next to the areas he's explaining, so that the reader can understand what area of the code is being explained.In addition, the book has numerous exercises to do at the end of each chapter that really give the reader a clear grasp of the subject matter that has been presented.  Most of the time, I tend to skip over these, because they seem so tedious and boring in other books....not so in this book.  The author tells you to go find a famous quote you like, and then use that to create an exercise where you're manipulating strings (as an example).I'd have to say that so far, this is one of the best books I've ever worked with in regards to learning programming.  If you're new to programming, and don't know what a variable is verses a string, this is a great book to start with.  If you're like myself, and have a basic understanding of programming syntax, but have some places that are still confusing (maybe you know how to get something to work, but not know why it works for example), this is also a great book.Best book I've read in regards to learning Python, by far.","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2021","Very detailed and clearly explained","5.0 out of 5 stars","","6",

But, it lets me know if I've at the level to be able to play it. Which brings me to this book. I have many beginner Python books. I wanted to teach a friend python and couldn't really recommend a book. On Kindle, I saw this had a free preview. If it didn't I wouldn't have purchased this book. But, it had I think four free chapters. I read chapters two and three. And was hooked. Now...I am compltely paperless. I do everything by PDF. However, I'm a book person.

"RS5Q1P6U4VAMJ","John","This book does all it can to make programming formidable and boring. It's not concise. It's too wordy.Most of it is filled with explanations and vanilla examples that just is not very enlightening.It's first chapter ""getting started"" will make you never start.Reading the first chapter, I decided not to read any further. Then my friend came along and did all that was intended in the chapter in less than a minute. The book spends a whole chapter on what can be done in a minute. I'm sure it meant well, but it is excessively full of explanations that are not relevant, and stuff that will just make the beginners crap.(Do beginners really have to know anything about Python 2? Or the difference between Python 2 and 3? Seriously?

"R13Z1BSD70DMKJ","Dan","Have had this for one day and the cover is already coming off. Nothing a little glue won’t fix, and that’s the downside of paperbacks that you have to put weight on to keep closed, in my opinion.BUT the inner content is well worth it. I’ve been wanting to learn programming for years but have often gone away discouraged because the tutorials and teachers randomly start throwing complicated problems at you out of nowhere.Not so with this book. It eases you into each topic, breaks it down very clearly, and has exercises throughout that you can follow along with. Make sure you follow along! There are specific exercises throughout, but I highly recommend typing out the example code and playing around with it/experimenting on your own as well. Then by the time you get to the exercises you’ll have a good idea about how to approach it.STICK WITH IT! I decided I wanted to learn to program 10 years ago! I would start for a week and then quit when it got too complicated and felt overwhelming. Then I’d come back to it a few years later, and same thing. Then it hit me one day, “If I had pushed through the first time and been patient, I’d have 10 years of experience as a programmer right now. Do I want to look back in another 10 years and feel that way again? Or do I want to push through this time so in 10 years I’ll actually have the experience under my belt!?”Easy answer!Stick with it. Be patient with yourself if things get too complicated or you “feel too dumb” to get it. If you hit a block, go back a few pages and go through it again. Everyone is selling “learn ____ quick!” books these days. It’s a good way to get random chunks of knowledge but a terrible way to master it. So be patient!And get this book. :).

"R1E5M1YLM2FZSP","idontwanttomakeone","My background is in JS, so I was looking for something that would both help me navigate installing Python3, learning the language syntax and differences in rules, and delve a little deeper in classes & objects.So far, it's clear that this is set up for absolute beginners, and I wouldn't call it a ""crash"" course. It's extremely thorough about walking you through common syntax errors you'll probably make on your own. I do like that it encourages you to play with breaking the code, which is absolutely necessary for learning how to code, but it's a little hand-holdy. I was expecting the guidance to loosen up as you went on, but as of chapter 6 out of the 11 chapters that introduce the topics, it's still very sheltered.I'd suggest people wanting a little more challenge/for things to stick a little longer read the first ""A Simple ___"" section whenever a topic is introduced, then jump to the exercises. See what you can accomplish there just from seeing the example code, and if you run into trouble, then go back through all of the ""how to do this exact thing"" stuff.Using the book this way, it's been a great reference book, and a quick read. I wish more complex ideas were introduced earlier, like conditionals/loops, so that the exercises could introduce more problem-solving than you can get with just print earlier, but I'm looking forward to the projects section.Oh, and yeah the binding did pop off on day 1.

If the author followed the practice problems ""C Programming Language"" by Dennis M. Ritchie and Brian W.

It covers more things than I originally anticipated. It's one of the few books(6) I originally purchased when getting into the Python Language. It also remains my favorite in starting out. For some reason a lot of ""beginner's"" books about SQL, C++, Python Ect seem to either assume you somehow already know how to code or project the feeling your 4yrs old. This book is NOT that. It's a prefect balance imo and even though I now have moved on, I still find myself referring back to it every once in a while. Starts out with how to install, how to code, make your own game within Python more.

The explanation to code and how it works is easy to understand.  I like the mini Try It Yourself within the chapter or towards the end, where you get to try out what you learned.  If you get stuck, a simple Google search will help you further expand your knowledge.  I am enjoying learning Python at my own pace.  I needed it this for work and it is helping tons!  If you are looking for a new program to learn or just want to advance your knowledge, pick up this book.  I am also teaching my 10-year old daughter how to program in Python.

At least it makes it easier to keep the book open at the page you are reading while using your other two hands on the computer keyboard. The instructions on how to complete the installation of Python and Sublime Text so they would work together was not clear enough for me – I had to get help before I could make anything work. But then, progress through the chapters seems slow, especially if you are going to do all the exercises: The explanations are clear enough but I kept on wanting to look ahead to find out how to do something the book hadn't got to yet, and this is where I found the most frustrating inadequacy: the index is not helpful enough. If you want to find out how to copy a list to a file, for example, you won't find  any reference to that in the index.  Searching the internet is much more productive. Perhaps I was looking for a reference book rather than  ""crash course"". I needed the book but it didn't work as a crash course for me.

Everyone seems to want to teach Python like it’s Algebra. I hated Algebra and never got higher than a ‘C’ in it.

I have covered 1.5 chapters each week for the last 7 weeks. It is quite evident that the author is a teacher because he understands that well thought out examples make a difference.

They were all good, HFP being the best of the group. But this book, in my opinion, is perfect. This is a lifelong programmer taking you through a perfectly logical learning course, laying a foundation from which to build upon. Just go through it slowly and methodically, type everything in the book along the way and ponder it, and I have no doubt you will learn this language and use it capably.The other thing I love is that he never goes more than a few pages without pausing for exercises, and the exercises are never too difficult. It's exactly what was just discussed, and the solutions are on his website if you need them (I rarely did bc of how well the material was presented).I emphatically recommend this.

"R1SGL2CVEQSKCP","Amazon Customer","I read this book after taking an introductory online course. The online course did a great job of helping me understand the core concepts of Python, but left out a lot of the conventions (such as formatting). This is where the book REALLY comes in handy. The author puts an emphasis on common formatting used within the industry.The examples and the exercises are extremely well thought out and really helped me understand the code. The examples are usually something you'd encounter in real-life and when the author expands the code for those examples its done so bit by bit so you get a full understanding of what is actually going on.First half of the book is all about learning python. The second half walks you through big projects, such as a video game, web page, or web application.

This course actually formed together many of the concepts which I spent years learning in classrooms with a far greater understanding.

Ch 9 (Classes) didn't stick the first time through, but maybe it's the material ??

Found myself in a position of typing in the code, and understanding the code, but knowing I could not write the code.  What makes it especially difficult was -- to save space -- the author plugged snippets of code into partial program listings while telling you in the text to delete sections of code.  I would suggest that's a very poor way of changing the code as it's extremely easy for the user to mess up.  I got frustrated to the point of just quitting several times working through this portion of the book.  This cost it a star.Also, the code ran extremely slow -- taking half an hour to load.  Not sure what that's about.  Looked online but couldn't find anybody with a similar problem.  Like everybody else said -- the binding is awful -- but the content is really good.

I was lucky to be immersed and programming in a clinical environment.

It has a thorough ""read-example-here"" approach and then relevant exercises you should do afterward. This is a great book to start learning Python as long as you're motivated to read!

"R1G9CVIGX3IR6B","David L.","The contents of the book are better than its manufactured quality.  Sadly, less than a week after receiving it, the cover came free of the rest of the book. It  was apparently only held on by two narrow strips of glue on the first and last pages, and no glue holding it to the actual spine!The book contents itself are pretty good, but it does stay fairly simple. I bought the book because of the format of the examples, with code, point by point descriptions of the code elements, and then the output.  Some of the examples don't go very deep. I was looking at loop iterations, and the book really only covered using them with a print statement, though I was hoping for how to set variables and perform calculations according to current list value.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2019","Not bad, but some disappointment","4.0 out of 5 stars","","39",

"R39RZIPXZYTZ6U","Seth Ward","I needed to learn basic Python for a specific project I had in mind. My previous ""code"" experience includes HTML/CSS and enough Javascript to dress up websites and make basic widgets to use at work. My hope with this book was to learn enough to get a barebones version of the project running then hand it off to a real programmer. I finished the first half of the book, which is the basics, and decided to try out a couple ideas before moving on to the ""example projects"" part of the book. The examples are great but some were honestly overkill for what I needed. To my surprise I had a working program in a few days.

I used Visual Studio Code to execute Python commands and it worked just fine! All the material in this book is well-written and easy to understand. I am really getting this and it feels great to master yet another programming language.  This is by far the best programming book that I have ever read and purchased.

"RGR5UQFA4F0AH","L B.","Seriously, buy this book.  My programming experience prior was limited to a single semester class where all I learned was basic concepts without any actual language skills, and that was over a decade ago.  Less than halfway through this excellent text, and I was already starting the command line game project I had in mind.  Honestly, I was skeptical before and probably wouldn't have bought the book if it had not been discounted, but having seen how quickly I was grasping the concepts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book at any price point.  There is a reason so many sources suggest this as a wonderful entry point to Python.tl:dr - Want to learn Python, Buy this book.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020","Buy this book","5.0 out of 5 stars","","3",
"RDP4G6JLACZYG","Taylor","my only complaint is, since this is an introductory book, it should give resources or cover common install issues such as placing things in the path. this is needed at the beginning of the book, and without prior programming/systems experience, this could be a huge complication.  being in path may or may not be the default, depending on your system and download specifications. however this book still deserves a five star rating because it is very straight forward, building skills and competency from the ground up.  i also really liked that there was a git and github section included because version control platforms can be confusing at first, but with a straight forward explanation, not hard to get used to.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020","Great introductory","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",
"R158P2UGR182PJ","Eric Wood","Other reviews that suggest this book moves too slowly and is repetitive are essentially correct. But I am not saying that is a negative...this is a great book to cement the fundamentals.

"R3A9EDMV4HX3IF","Jonathan","I am taking an online college course for intro to scripting in Python, and there is no book with the course, just an online tutorial that you use. The online ""book"" is streamlined and wasn't cutting it for me. The Crash Course book is so much better and it fills in a lot of gaps. My only complaint is the book should have been spiral bound. The binding isn't great for a book this size and you need the spiral option to have the book stay open while you type in the exercises, which are great. Highly recommend the book for true beginners. Probably too basic for anyone else, but it is at the level i needed.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","Perfect for beginners - wish it was spiral bound","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0",
"RA2UW2W9DR851","B","I’ve tried a lot of the free tutorials online: classes, pdf, etc. and nothing compares to this physical book. It starts off like most tutorials with the user creating the “hello world” program, but then uses each chapter to introduce a new topic while still using the topics previously learned. If I forget something I can easily flip back and refresh my memory. The chapters are short and concise, the appendices are helpful, and the book is easy to follow. I’ve given up many times when trying to use online guides and tutorials, but I find myself wanting to spend my free time working through this book and thoroughly enjoy it.","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2021","The best Python course I’ve found yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",

I'm only four chapters into the book and I gotta say - Python is finally making sense to me! I've tried reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and I have no doubt that it's a good book. However, for me, it was not a good starting point and I found myself lost trying to read through the first few chapters - maybe I'll re-read ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" afterwards after I finish ""Python Crash Course"". I'll do a follow-up review of this book when I'm done, but that won't be for a while; I'm going at my own pace and ensuring that I understand each topic and lesson.

"R17D6VX0MH3SZY","Dear MR.J","What is good about it? It teaches you the basics of Python But it does not have any advanced materials inside.  Evey little example is well explained. It has a lot of examples are presented. It also asked readers to do exercises after concept.However, I wish it comes with an answer for those after chapter exercises. Otherwise, it becomes meaningless because you won't know if you got it or not. Overall, well explained but somewhat too much explanation. Thus, this might be good for people who do not have any programming skill. Also, words are simple and straightforward.Update: Thanks to the author reply, there are solutions online. But I still think it explained things too much. Thus, costed too much reading for a simple concept.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019","Good for beginner but does not go too far or deep","4.0 out of 5 stars","","109",
